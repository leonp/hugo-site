Now, we all know a basic citizen income will never happen in the UK, because of [our punitive attitude to benefits][1]. However, it&#8217;s interesting to look at how it would affect us *if* we actually created a system that supported people regardless of their circumstances. We can but dream.

The following scenarios and figures are based on [Dr Malcolm Torry&#8217;s work for the Citizen&#8217;s Income Trust][2] (see Appendix 16). He claims the proposals are revenue neutral.

The state would give every citizen a fixed income regardless of their salary, pension, investment income, age and marital status. Dr Torry proposes income levels based on current income support and pension credit rates:

  Weekly basic citizen income amounts

## Example 1

A and B are married and have two school aged children. A earns the national average wage of £26,500 a year. B hasn&#8217;t worked for four years in order to bring up the children. B would like to find a part–time job or course in order to begin a return to work.

The family collects £160 a month in child tax credits and £134 child benefit.

After tax and national insurance (NI) A takes home £1700 a month. This results in a total income of £1994 a month.

At the moment it&#8217;s next to impossible for B to find work or study, because they&#8217;ll lose their tax credits and have to start paying for pre and after school childcare, and any course costs.

Under a basic citizen income scheme A would pay more income tax because there&#8217;d be no tax allowance. Using the current tax rates, tax and NI add up to 32%, so A would take home £1502 a month.

Basic income is paid to all citizens regardless of age. Using Torry&#8217;s suggested rates, the family would receive £1103 citizen income a month. This results in a total income of £2605 a month, £611 more than the current amount.

### How things would change

B could look for work without worrying about losing child tax credits. If the government also subsidised free childcare, it would be even more attractive. Study would be a realistic option.

There are also several indirect benefits. A currently pays £60 accident, sickness and unemployment insurance. They wouldn&#8217;t need to pay as much because redundancy wouldn&#8217;t be as ruinous as before (moving to part–time work would be a realistic option, for example).

A could change their work hours to share childcare duties. It might be possible to go part–time in order to improve B&#8217;s job and study prospects.

A citizen income would drastically improve financial security, work and study flexibility and the quality of A and B&#8217;s life (and their children&#8217;s).

## Example 2

C brings up three children on their own. Their youngest child has turned 5, which means they have to move to [Employment and Support Allowance (ESA)][3] benefit of £71.70 a week.

After 13 weeks they&#8217;ll be put into a sinisterly named “work related activity group” and face sanctions if they don&#8217;t attend job interviews or do “work–related activity”. [Work related activity][4] is work for free (also known as [workfare][5]).

They currently claim £376.11 a month child tax credits and £204.10 child benefit. Total income is £890.91 a month.

C would like to either work part–time or, because they have no formal qualifications, begin an access course so they can train for a job.

C would lose their ESA under the current rules if they started a course.

Under the basic citizen income scheme, the family&#8217;s income would increase by a modest £148 a month to £1038.91. C wouldn&#8217;t have to start unpaid “work–related activity”, and they&#8217;d be free to either study or work part–time without losing any money.

### How things would change

C wouldn&#8217;t have to worry about a change in circumstances affecting their children&#8217;s well–being. They could also concentrate on planning some sort of career, rather than how their income changes on a week to week basis, or working for free.

A common theme to these examples is education. Another indirect consequence of a basic income would be a better trained workforce.

## Why it won&#8217;t happen

If Torry&#8217;s cost neutral claims are true, then it&#8217;s hard to argue against a basic citizen income. They serve the government&#8217;s aim of *getting people back to work* far better than the current means tested system.

If you&#8217;re of a neoliberal bent they also open up several interesting possibilities around ‘flexible’ labour laws. If unemployment isn&#8217;t entirely financially ruinous, then zero hour contracts and no quibble hiring and firing may seem a little fairer than they do at the moment. (*Note – this isn&#8217;t my view!*)

However, the main drawback is that an untested citizen income isn&#8217;t punitive. In real life, A is encouraged to feel that they&#8217;re paying for C to ‘do nothing’ while they struggle on a low income, instead of questioning why their salary is so inadequate. Benefits and work are an exercise in division and revenge.
