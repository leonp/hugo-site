> Switzerland will hold a vote on whether to introduce a basic income for all adults, in a further sign of growing public activism over pay inequality since the financial crisis. A grassroots committee is calling for all adults in Switzerland to receive an unconditional income of 2,500 Swiss francs (2,800 USD) per month from the state, with the aim of providing a financial safety net for the population. <cite><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/04/us-swiss-pay-idUSBRE9930O620131004">Reuters</a></cite> via [Basic Income UK][1]

As you&#8217;re no doubt very bored of hearing, I&#8217;m interested in the idea of a Basic Citizen Income: a non–withdrawable, non–means tested income for every UK citizen, regardless of employment status, age and marital status.

I blogged [a couple of examples of how it might work in the UK][2], using figures published by Dr Malcolm Torry. Unfortunately, it&#8217;ll never happen, due to our punitive attitude to poor people.<figure class="figure alignnone">

What&#8217;s interesting about the Swiss proposal is the amount they&#8217;ll be voting on. In the UK 2800 USD amounts to about £1750, i.e. the average full–time worker&#8217;s net pay.

In my examples, anyone over the age of 24 would receive £308 a month, *around £1400 less than in Switzerland*. And yet it still seems a million miles away. (Note: Dr Torry&#8217;s figures assume housing and council tax benefits remain the same. They substantially increase UK state derived income.)

What does this say about UK expectations of pay and quality of life?
