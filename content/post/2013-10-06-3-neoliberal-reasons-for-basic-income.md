A Basic Citizens&#8217; Income (BCI) is one of those subjects that&#8217;s fun to think about (if you&#8217;re philosophically or politically inclined – I guess other people find it mortally dull, for which I apologise).

It serves as a thought experiment – what if the role of the state wasn&#8217;t to punish poverty? – which can lead down some surprising alleyways.

For example *what is the right&#8217;s attitude to BCI*?

Your instinct says *the right will absolutely hate* a BCI, and you probably wouldn&#8217;t be mistaken. It doesn&#8217;t exactly fit in with [Gideon&#8217;s *something for nothing culture* rhetoric][1], and its main UK proponents are various leftwingers and the Green Party.

But there&#8217;s no inherent reason for the right to adopt a punitive attitude to welfare. If the starting point of any welfare system is *how do we encourage entrpreneuralism*? (how I hate that word) or *how do we minimise state bureacracy*?, or even *how do we encourage people to work*? then BCI becomes a lot more attractive.

Of course – as I always point out – this will not happen, because the starting point of all social policy is *how do we punish poverty*?<figure class="figure alignnone">

But here are 3 reasons for the right to embrace BCI:

## 1. It encourages entrepreneurs

The current benefits system deters people from working piecemeal. As soon as you work one single hour, you lose benefits. This means that it&#8217;s only worth working if you can work lots of hours on a regular, predictable basis. Working now and again is not only financially pointless, it means you have to deal with the nightmare bureaucracy of the DWP.

Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;ve worked for a couple of years as a ‘junior’ web developer. You&#8217;ve kept up to date with all the latest trends in your field and know you could do a better job than the company that just made you redundant.

A BCI would encourage you to take a risk. You could set yourself up as a self–employed developer and starting bidding for work. You wouldn&#8217;t have to rely on being able to secure credit, or a rich mum and dad.

If your business failed you&#8217;d have your BCI to fall back on. If it was slow to take off – building a reputation is difficult – and only earned a couple of hundred quid a month you&#8217;d still keep that income and pay tax on it.

Who knows – over time you might become a really successful business woman, while the economy gains a high quality web developer. You might start employing people.

## 2. It rids us of state bureaucracy

The current income support and tax credits system is a Kafkaesque bureaucracy of different rates, forms, ages, sanctions and administrators (although this does create employment, ironically enough. Imagine if there were no poor people to keep tabs on and sanction – no poverty industry.)

If *everyone* receives BCI regardless of age, marital status, income and employment status, there&#8217;s nothing to process except a weekly or monthly payment. No signing on, back to work schemes or changes in circumstances forms.

In the UK, [BCI would save £7 billion per year in tax credits and income support administration costs][3] (Word doc).

## 3. It makes it easier to liberalise employment laws and create a ‘free’ market

The right argues minimum hour contracts, a minimum wage and redundancy protection rights ‘stifle’ business growth.

While far more ‘protective’ countries than the UK seem to manage perfectly well (Germany, most obviously), other traditionally [social democratic countries such as Denmark have adopted an even more neoliberal approach][4].

Unlike the UK, Denmark has extremely high unemployment benefit levels. In effect, there&#8217;s a contract between the state, workers and employers. Employers can hire and fire at will, but workers don&#8217;t face ruinous consequences if they lose their jobs.

In the UK there&#8217;s no such contract, which makes employment law liberalisation extremely unfair and dangerous to workers.

BCI could form part of a contract between workers and employers. It would allow employers to hire and fire more freely, while giving workers a basic level of security. The government could abolish the minimum wage, meaning market forces would determine pay.

BCI appeals to a strain of anarchism common to neoliberal and leftwing thought. It&#8217;s a shame such a rational, practical idea that works across ideologies doesn&#8217;t have a chance in the UK.
