I’m Leon, web services manager at Suffolk Libraries, the industrial and provident society Suffolk County Council contracted to run Suffolk’s libraries in 2012.

Before I was a web manager I was a teacher of English.

I blog here, and the normal disclaimer applies: these are my opinions, not those of someone or something else.

I write about managing a website, coding, design, writing, and occasionally I’ll discuss other things: proper writers’ writing, politics (especially a Basic Citizens’ Income), music, where I live, where I’d like to live and anything else.
