			<p>I know next to nothing about economics. I&#8217;ve read the odd bit of Marx and lots of modern blogs, which are surprisingly often about Mr Marx, but I didn&#8217;t study the subject and I haven&#8217;t read Piketty&#8217;s <cite>Capital in the Twenty-First Century</cite>.</p>

<p>I can however say with confidence that my &#8220;household budget&#8221; and the UK&#8217;s economy are entirely different things. I can&#8217;t print money, for one thing.</p>

<p>Of course, right leaning politicians like to make the connection between small, personal budgets and the economy because they can then say &#8220;just like you, we need to cut back and balance the books, and you can&#8217;t be paid much&#8221;. And because the English like a bit of belt-tightening rhetoric and need to think poor people are a bunch of wasters, everyone thinks it&#8217;s brilliant and your children&#8217;s centre closes. So it goes.</p>

<p>I still don&#8217;t understand where fuck off huge mortgages and tax cuts for really rich people fit into this. I guess economists can explain.</p>

<p>I therefore get why <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-28389816">Ed Miliband needs to bang on about balancing national budgets</a>. It&#8217;s electoral tactics. But does he really <em>believe</em> it?</p>

<p><a href="http://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/stumbling_and_mumbling/2014/07/internalizing-constraints.html">Chris Dillow</a> and <a href="http://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Blog/2014/07/22/do-you-have-to-put-your-head-in-the-sand-to-want-to-be-chancellor/">Richard Murphy</a> have raised this point over the last week. Dillow, who often writes about the psychology of the economy, described comparisons between personal budgets and national economies as <q>the economic illiteracy of the media and voters who have swallowed half&#8211;witted guff about balancing the nation&#8217;s books</q> &#8211; but he fears Miliband might have come to actually believe the guff.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s the old New Labour approach of repeating the same message until everyone believes it. Including yourself.</p>

<p>Does the Labour Party rank and file believe it too? Frightening not only because it&#8217;s nonsense, but also, as Dillow argues, because it always ends in disappointment. After 13 years of a Labour government a coalition was able to dismantle pretty much the whole welfare state as we know it in a couple of years.</p>

<p>The Labour PartyÂ <em>is</em> largely pragmatic because it thinks the electorate in marginal seats is fundamentally conservative in its outlook. But none of the members I know joined the party to bang on about making cuts to public services. However, there are several MPs who seem to <em>believe</em> this austerity rhetoric, <a href="https://twitter.com/theloveofwilde/status/490916605199917057">even the odd activist</a>.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s something in Labour that says you have to <em>believe</em> in the argument behind a policy, even when it&#8217;s apostasy. One of the many advantages the Tory party holds over Labour is its understanding that it&#8217;s all tactics: Only the goal matters.</p>
