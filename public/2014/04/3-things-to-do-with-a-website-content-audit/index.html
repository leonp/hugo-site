<p>A year or so ago I posted <a href="http://leonpaternoster.com/2013/04/carrying-out-a-web-content-audit/" title="Carrying out a web content audit">a guide to carrying out a content audit</a>. At the time I was getting to grips with the <a href="http://suffolklibraries.co.uk">Suffolk Libraries</a> website, and the audit was a really useful way to understand the library service and what we were trying to do online.</p>

<p>Now we have a (hopefully) sane IA and most of the redundant content has been stripped away, the audit has a different purpose. I use it to prune pages and make sure everything&#8217;s up to date. The original audit took days, now it takes on hour or two.</p>

<p>So here are 3 things you can do with a content audit once you&#8217;re happy with your website&#8217;s structure:</p>

<h2 id="toc_0">1. Make sure content is assigned to the right owner</h2>

<p>Staff move on, go on paternity leave or get promoted. Your organisation structure changes too. Update your content owners accordingly.</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">2. Delete pages and files</h2>

<p>The Suffolk Libraries website consists of 144 static pages, including redirects. This is manageable for one person.</p>

<p>Fewer pages and files make it easier to:</p>

<ul>
<li>structure your website</li>
<li>return relevant results from searches</li>
<li>navigate pages</li>
</ul>

<p>So the first question you need to ask of any page or file is <em>do we need this?* If you think the answer&#8217;s *no</em>, check your analytics and search logs and ask the content owner.</p>

<h2 id="toc_2">3. Update content</h2>

<p>You&#8217;ll probably have an idea of what content needs updating, but the audit will <em>force</em> you to review everything. It&#8217;ll throw light on those obscure corners of the website you&#8217;d forgotten about.</p>

<p>Information ages quite naturally, but sometimes something unpredictable happens. For example, a new government might make changes to the National Curriculum, so your children&#8217;s reading advice pages might need updating.</p>

<p>Often content owners will come to you with changes, but it&#8217;s ultimately your responsibility to make sure everything&#8217;s up to date. And it&#8217;s a good thing when you show enough interest in other people&#8217;s content to ask questions about it.</p>

<p>The first content audit I did for Suffolk Libraries was a major piece of work, but it was really important to get a handle on the website. Now it&#8217;s a relatively painless way to keep the site lean and healthy.</p>
