<p>A Basic Citizens&#8217; Income (BCI) is one of those subjects that&#8217;s fun to think about (if you&#8217;re philosophically or politically inclined – I guess other people find it mortally dull, for which I apologise).</p>

<p>It serves as a thought experiment – what if the role of the state wasn&#8217;t to punish poverty? – which can lead down some surprising alleyways.</p>

<p>For example <em>what is the right&#8217;s attitude to BCI</em>?</p>

<p>Your instinct says <em>the right will absolutely hate</em> a BCI, and you probably wouldn&#8217;t be mistaken. It doesn&#8217;t exactly fit in with <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24327470">Gideon&#8217;s <em>something for nothing culture</em> rhetoric</a>, and its main UK proponents are various leftwingers and the Green Party.</p>

<p>But there&#8217;s no inherent reason for the right to adopt a punitive attitude to welfare. If the starting point of any welfare system is <em>how do we encourage entrpreneuralism</em>? (how I hate that word) or <em>how do we minimise state bureacracy</em>?, or even <em>how do we encourage people to work</em>? then BCI becomes a lot more attractive.</p>

<p>Of course – as I always point out – this will not happen, because the starting point of all social policy is <em>how do we punish poverty</em>?<figure class="figure alignnone"></p>

<p><img class="size-full wp-image-64" alt="Two women sitting at a table in a cafe" src="http://leonpaternoster.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/newsnight.jpg" width="595" height="301" /><figcaption class="secondary">BBC Newsnight political editor Allegra Stratton <a href="http://politicalscrapbook.net/2012/06/newsnight-allegra-stratton-exposed-shanene-thorpe/">falsely portrayed Shanene Thorpe as a “jobless ponce”</a>. Her prejudice is widespread – even at the supposedly objective BBC.</figcaption></figure>
But here are 3 reasons for the right to embrace BCI:</p>

<h2 id="toc_0">1. It encourages entrepreneurs</h2>

<p>The current benefits system deters people from working piecemeal. As soon as you work one single hour, you lose benefits. This means that it&#8217;s only worth working if you can work lots of hours on a regular, predictable basis. Working now and again is not only financially pointless, it means you have to deal with the nightmare bureaucracy of the DWP.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;ve worked for a couple of years as a ‘junior’ web developer. You&#8217;ve kept up to date with all the latest trends in your field and know you could do a better job than the company that just made you redundant.</p>

<p>A BCI would encourage you to take a risk. You could set yourself up as a self–employed developer and starting bidding for work. You wouldn&#8217;t have to rely on being able to secure credit, or a rich mum and dad.</p>

<p>If your business failed you&#8217;d have your BCI to fall back on. If it was slow to take off – building a reputation is difficult – and only earned a couple of hundred quid a month you&#8217;d still keep that income and pay tax on it.</p>

<p>Who knows – over time you might become a really successful business woman, while the economy gains a high quality web developer. You might start employing people.</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">2. It rids us of state bureaucracy</h2>

<p>The current income support and tax credits system is a Kafkaesque bureaucracy of different rates, forms, ages, sanctions and administrators (although this does create employment, ironically enough. Imagine if there were no poor people to keep tabs on and sanction – no poverty industry.)</p>

<p>If <em>everyone</em> receives BCI regardless of age, marital status, income and employment status, there&#8217;s nothing to process except a weekly or monthly payment. No signing on, back to work schemes or changes in circumstances forms.</p>

<p>In the UK, <a href="http://www.citizensincome.org/filelibrary/Archived%20Publications/Citizen%27s%20Income%20booklet%202013.doc">BCI would save £7 billion per year in tax credits and income support administration costs</a> (Word doc).</p>

<h2 id="toc_2">3. It makes it easier to liberalise employment laws and create a ‘free’ market</h2>

<p>The right argues minimum hour contracts, a minimum wage and redundancy protection rights ‘stifle’ business growth.</p>

<p>While far more ‘protective’ countries than the UK seem to manage perfectly well (Germany, most obviously), other traditionally <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark#Public_policy">social democratic countries such as Denmark have adopted an even more neoliberal approach</a>.</p>

<p>Unlike the UK, Denmark has extremely high unemployment benefit levels. In effect, there&#8217;s a contract between the state, workers and employers. Employers can hire and fire at will, but workers don&#8217;t face ruinous consequences if they lose their jobs.</p>

<p>In the UK there&#8217;s no such contract, which makes employment law liberalisation extremely unfair and dangerous to workers.</p>

<p>BCI could form part of a contract between workers and employers. It would allow employers to hire and fire more freely, while giving workers a basic level of security. The government could abolish the minimum wage, meaning market forces would determine pay.</p>

<p>BCI appeals to a strain of anarchism common to neoliberal and leftwing thought. It&#8217;s a shame such a rational, practical idea that works across ideologies doesn&#8217;t have a chance in the UK.</p>
