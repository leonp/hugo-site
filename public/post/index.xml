      <title>Households, deficits and belief</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2014/07/households-deficits-and-belief/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I know next to nothing about economics. I&amp;#8217;ve read the odd bit of Marx and lots of modern blogs, which are surprisingly often about Mr Marx, but I didn&amp;#8217;t study the subject and I haven&amp;#8217;t read Piketty&amp;#8217;s &lt;cite&gt;Capital in the Twenty-First Century&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can however say with confidence that my &amp;#8220;household budget&amp;#8221; and the UK&amp;#8217;s economy are entirely different things. I can&amp;#8217;t print money, for one thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, right leaning politicians like to make the connection between small, personal budgets and the economy because they can then say &amp;#8220;just like you, we need to cut back and balance the books, and you can&amp;#8217;t be paid much&amp;#8221;. And because the English like a bit of belt-tightening rhetoric and need to think poor people are a bunch of wasters, everyone thinks it&amp;#8217;s brilliant and your children&amp;#8217;s centre closes. So it goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still don&amp;#8217;t understand where fuck off huge mortgages and tax cuts for really rich people fit into this. I guess economists can explain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I therefore get why &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-28389816&#34;&gt;Ed Miliband needs to bang on about balancing national budgets&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s electoral tactics. But does he really &lt;em&gt;believe&lt;/em&gt; it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/stumbling_and_mumbling/2014/07/internalizing-constraints.html&#34;&gt;Chris Dillow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Blog/2014/07/22/do-you-have-to-put-your-head-in-the-sand-to-want-to-be-chancellor/&#34;&gt;Richard Murphy&lt;/a&gt; have raised this point over the last week. Dillow, who often writes about the psychology of the economy, described comparisons between personal budgets and national economies as &lt;q&gt;the economic illiteracy of the media and voters who have swallowed half&amp;#8211;witted guff about balancing the nation&amp;#8217;s books&lt;/q&gt; &amp;#8211; but he fears Miliband might have come to actually believe the guff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s the old New Labour approach of repeating the same message until everyone believes it. Including yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does the Labour Party rank and file believe it too? Frightening not only because it&amp;#8217;s nonsense, but also, as Dillow argues, because it always ends in disappointment. After 13 years of a Labour government a coalition was able to dismantle pretty much the whole welfare state as we know it in a couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Labour Party &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; largely pragmatic because it thinks the electorate in marginal seats is fundamentally conservative in its outlook. But none of the members I know joined the party to bang on about making cuts to public services. However, there are several MPs who seem to &lt;em&gt;believe&lt;/em&gt; this austerity rhetoric, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/theloveofwilde/status/490916605199917057&#34;&gt;even the odd activist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s something in Labour that says you have to &lt;em&gt;believe&lt;/em&gt; in the argument behind a policy, even when it&amp;#8217;s apostasy. One of the many advantages the Tory party holds over Labour is its understanding that it&amp;#8217;s all tactics: Only the goal matters.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tabbed navigation didn&#39;t work on our site</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2014/07/tabbed-navigation-didnt-work-on-our-site/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 10 Jul 2014 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/2014/07/tabbed-navigation-didnt-work-on-our-site/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was using &lt;a href=&#34;http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/tabs.html&#34;&gt;tabbed navigation&lt;/a&gt; on a couple of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://suffolklibraries.co.uk&#34;&gt;Suffolk Libraries&lt;/a&gt; website pages. By tabbed navigation I mean a single document&amp;#8217;s content divided by horizontal tabs, so you don&amp;#8217;t see it all at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;ll look something like this:&lt;figure class=&#34;figure aligncenter&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://leonpaternoster.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/tabs.gif&#34; alt=&#34;Tabbed navigation within a page&#34; width=&#34;860&#34; height=&#34;216&#34; /&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&#34;secondary&#34;&gt;Tabbed navigation used to break up a single document.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
Tabs might seem a good idea because they break content up, thereby making it easier to interpret. But it&amp;#8217;s the single design element that got the most complaints after my redesign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not that users didn&amp;#8217;t get how to use the tabs (although initial testing indicated the labels had to be clearly styled as links – in the picture above, users might have struggled identifying the tabs). No, it was simply because &lt;strong&gt;tabs can break the back button&lt;/strong&gt;. Users see each tab as a separate page, when in reality they&amp;#8217;re just parts of the same, single page. Although it might seem boring, I found in most cases it makes users&amp;#8217; lives a lot easier if you actually make each tab a separate page, or plump for a single, long document, and find other ways to present it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Design Observer design not for us</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2014/07/design-observer-design-not-for-us/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 05 Jul 2014 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/2014/07/design-observer-design-not-for-us/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;History repeats itself quickly in the world of web design – it seems like only yesterday &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.fawny.org/2009/08/12/mock-do-1/&#34;&gt;we were lambasting &lt;cite&gt;Design Observer&lt;/cite&gt; for its new–not–at–all–new design&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to 2014 and we&amp;#8217;re making the &lt;a href=&#34;http://typographica.org/on-typography/questions-for-the-new-design-observer/&#34;&gt;same criticisms&lt;/a&gt;: poor font choice, tiny, indistinct type, bugginess. Add some really slow loading and unresponsiveness and you have 2014&amp;#8242;s version (although to be fair the site sort of adjusts to my Nexus phone – I&amp;#8217;m guessing it sniffs rather than scales).&lt;figure class=&#34;figure aligncenter&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://designobserver.com&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;full-bleed&#34; src=&#34;http://leonpaternoster.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/do.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot of the Design Observer website&#34; width=&#34;860&#34; height=&#34;444&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&#34;secondary&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Design Observer&lt;/cite&gt;: Let me count the ways&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
And yet. This website wasn&amp;#8217;t really written for me. I&amp;#8217;d go as far as to say I don&amp;#8217;t even understand it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who exactly is it for? Older design veterans who don&amp;#8217;t deal in the grubby functionality of fluid sized screens (i.e. &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.layervault.com/comments/78785&#34;&gt;designers who aren&amp;#8217;t working class&lt;/a&gt;)? If that is the case then – actual crapness (the huge fixed header, the strange dropdown at the top of the screen etc.) aside – it may do its job well enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you dig seeing paragraphs set in Archer on screen, and like small blocks of text, and spend your day on a Mac with a large screen, &lt;cite&gt;Design Observer&lt;/cite&gt; has been &lt;em&gt;designed&lt;/em&gt; just for you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chromebooks and wifi in the library (this is the future)</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2014/07/chromebooks-and-wifi-in-the-library-this-is-the-future/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 02 Jul 2014 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/2014/07/chromebooks-and-wifi-in-the-library-this-is-the-future/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last few months we’ve been making two big changes to Suffolk libraries&amp;#8217; IT. Firstly, we’ve been installing wifi, so customers can come into a library and use their phone/laptop/tablet for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re doing the final testing at &lt;a href=&#34;http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/branches/ipswich-county-library/&#34;&gt;Ipswich County&lt;/a&gt;, Suffolk’s biggest library. You can come in and use the (very quick) wifi now – we should officially ‘launch’ the service in the next couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For years, libraries have provided slow, out of date Windows PCs. Customers come in and sit at banks of ugly tower computers and wait for 15 minutes while their PC logs in, before checking email, word processing, going on Facebook etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re finally replacing these PCs with a mix of high spec Dells and, more interestingly, Chrome PCs and Chromebooks.&lt;figure class=&#34;figure aligncenter&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;full-bleed&#34; src=&#34;http://leonpaternoster.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/chromebook.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;A laptop on a desk&#34; width=&#34;860&#34; height=&#34;645&#34; /&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&#34;secondary&#34;&gt;A Chromebook. Small, light and very fast: takes about 5s to login&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
So I’m writing this post (in my lunch, natch) in County Library’s fabulous Nortgate Room, under the gaze of a stainedglass Francis Bacon. I’m using a superquick laptop provided by the library and some nifty, free wifi.&lt;figure class=&#34;figure aligncenter&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;full-bleed&#34; src=&#34;http://leonpaternoster.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/bacon.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Stained glass window of Francis Bacon&#34; width=&#34;860&#34; height=&#34;645&#34; /&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&#34;secondary&#34;&gt;Ipswich County Library Northgate Room (it&amp;#8217;s Francis Bacon, not Lord Blackadder)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
This has to be the future of libraries – a free, non-commercial, flexible space where you can relax and spend a couple of hours. It beats going to a coffee shop hands down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if we did just have a cafe here too…&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The longest day</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2014/06/the-longest-day/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2014 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/2014/06/the-longest-day/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;figure alignnone&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;full-bleed&#34; src=&#34;http://leonpaternoster.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/stonehenge.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Stonehenge&#34; width=&#34;850&#34; height=&#34;531&#34; /&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&#34;secondary&#34;&gt;A circle of old stones in Wiltshire&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
I loved this &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jun/21/from-heritage-to-heretics-stonehenge-making-history&#34;&gt;Will Self piece on English Heritage and its demerging and museumification of Stonehenge&lt;/a&gt; (both are words because authors create words).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stonehenge stands at the centre of a complex web of ideas linking ownership, knowledge and consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Stonehenge’s meaning changes over time, and doesn’t become fixed in, say, 1920. Fittingly, we now have a neoliberal circle of stones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the vast timescale over which humans have interacted with the English landscape, it seems plausible that archaeologists of the distant future will concoct some narrative to unify these works with the stones themselves, perhaps one based on the astronomical alignment of the tunnel with the decayed footings of some vast M-shaped golden arches that were mysteriously erected some decades later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can picture deadly earnest archaeologists, trowels dangling, theorising with a glint in their eye over MacDonalds and leylines on a BBC4 Stonehenge Watch in 3145.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its fantastic age Stonehenge has absolutely zero inherent meaning. Nothing in Britain, or anywhere else, does. Yet we can’t create anything exciting from Stonehenge, or find new, meaningful sites to theorise over. Might as well build a Prince Charles designed, Crest Nicolson, faux Georgian housing estate around it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The morality of work</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2014/06/the-morality-of-work/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 11 Jun 2014 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/2014/06/the-morality-of-work/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On the &amp;#8220;morality of work&amp;#8221;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the idea that people essentially have a duty to work, an inherent need to work, that work is an instrument to achieving things like self&amp;#8211;esteem and social cohesion. Obviously, this is sort of true. What really matters here is how you define Work. What gets thought of as Work and what is &amp;#8220;not work&amp;#8221; becomes a real bone of contention. In our current society, care work – whether for children, siblings, relatives, friends, strangers – is not considered Work. Housework is not considered Work. Study is not Work. Charity is not Work. Social work is not Work. But all these things are inherent in social cohesion, they are just not valued particularly highly as far as financial reward goes. &amp;#8212;&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.irishleftreview.org/2014/06/11/basic-income-summer-forum/&#34;&gt;Basic Income Summer Forum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is only partly right. If we&amp;#8217;re being honest, most people &amp;#8211; apart from politicians when they&amp;#8217;re arguing for things like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.boycottworkfare.org/&#34;&gt;workfare&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; don&amp;#8217;t see work in such romantic terms. It&amp;#8217;s not a route to self&amp;#8211;esteem, social cohesion etc. etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work for most people is above all else &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt;, something that has to be done in order to pay the bills. Antipathy to Basic Income (or any form of benefit) comes from the view that because &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; have to work hard to buy food and pay the gas bill, &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; shouldn&amp;#8217;t get free money from me. &lt;em&gt;That&amp;#8217;s&lt;/em&gt; the morality of work.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Liked this picture of an 18th century book &lt;cite&gt;Conjectures on Original Composition&lt;/cite&gt; by Edward Young:&lt;figure class=&#34;figure aligncenter&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://leonpaternoster.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/small-book.gif&#34; alt=&#34;A narrow 18th century book&#34; width=&#34;399&#34; height=&#34;629&#34; /&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&#34;secondary&#34;&gt;From &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.collisiondetection.net/mt/archives/2014/02/_thats_one_of_t.php&#34;&gt;Collision Detection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
It shows how resilient we are as readers – we can deal with any ‘difficult’ measure. Another possible similarity between now and then is the sheer &lt;em&gt;mass&lt;/em&gt; of the stuff we&amp;#8217;re publishing; a fact plenty will bemoan, but I rather like this democratic, unpretentious fecundity (he said, pretentiously…) Also chimes with &lt;a href=&#34;http://leonpaternoster.com/2011/01/short-attention-spans-mobile-phones-and-the-future-of-reading/&#34; title=&#34;Short attention spans, mobile phones and the future of reading&#34;&gt;something I wrote many moons ago&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Football, place, ownership and fans</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2014/05/football-place-ownership-and-fans/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2014 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/2014/05/football-place-ownership-and-fans/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the good old days – say 20 years ago or so – your football club was owned and run by local toffs and businessmen (it was always men, and still is, in the main). In Ipswich Town&amp;#8217;s case it was the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cobbold_%28businessman%29&#34;&gt;Cobbold family&lt;/a&gt; followed by John Kerr and then &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Sheepshanks&#34;&gt;David Sheepshanks&lt;/a&gt; (Old Etonians all).&lt;figure class=&#34;figure alignnone&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;full-bleed&#34; src=&#34;http://leonpaternoster.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/robson-cobbold.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Bobby Robson and John Cobbold at Ipswich Station&#34; width=&#34;630&#34; height=&#34;446&#34; /&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&#34;secondary&#34;&gt;Bobby Robson and John Cobbold at Ipswich Station (from the East Anglian Daily Times archive)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
Club finances weren&amp;#8217;t managed particularly well. True, Ipswich won an FA Cup, a UEFA Cup and qualified for Europe season after season after the Cobbolds hired Bobby Robson, but when Bobby left to manage England we were saddled with a big new stand and debt. Bobby&amp;#8217;s departure and our reduced finances forced us to sell our best players and, apart from brief forays into the top league under John Lyall and George Burley, things haven&amp;#8217;t really improved since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years – and we can blame the Premier League for this – the finances became increasingly precarious, meaning we often had to sell our best players, such as Mauricio Tarricco to Spurs on the eve of Barclays calling in our overdraft. Finally, we went into administration in 2003 after splashing out on high profile flops like Finidi George, Ulrich le Pen and Matteo Sereni.&lt;figure class=&#34;figure alignnone&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://leonpaternoster.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/tarrico.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Mauricio Tarrico&#34; width=&#34;700&#34; height=&#34;507&#34; /&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&#34;secondary&#34;&gt;Mauricio Tarrico. A future manager, maybe.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
Still, at least the football club remained recognisably &lt;em&gt;local&lt;/em&gt;. In spite of our decline, we&amp;#8217;re left with memories of Suffolk people and experiences: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/ipswich-town/6547769/Footballs-greatest-eccentric-Ipswich-Towns-John-Cobbold.html&#34;&gt;the eccentric Lord Cobbold&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8216;s famous claim that “There is no crisis at Ipswich until the white wine runs out in the boardroom”, or when he mistook the Ipswich team for a bunch of local lads playing football on a beach in Greece. Or David Sheepshanks on the Wembley pitch after we&amp;#8217;d finally won promotion to the Premier League in 2000. All these local characters and experiences helped form our identity as an idiosyncratic, friendly club.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, of course, has all changed – and the football has got worse. In 2007 the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Evans&#34;&gt;Marcus Evans Group&lt;/a&gt; took over Ipswich Town, and we became a subsidiary of a larger, tax–efficient business, a punt on Premier League millions. Marcus Evans himself may have been born in Bury St Edmunds, but his business is registered in Bermuda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many other clubs, we&amp;#8217;re in debt to our owner – a multinational businessman&amp;#8217;s largesse only extends so far. While this removes the immediate threat of administration, it does mean our future is bound to the fortunes – and whim – of one businessman. And the effect on the club has been marked: it&amp;#8217;s become bland, dull and mean, bearing all the &lt;a href=&#34;http://leonpaternoster.com/2013/11/itfc-zero-hours/&#34; title=&#34;Ipswich Town FC: A poor employer&#34;&gt;familiar marks of a modern, identikit multinational business&lt;/a&gt;: zero hour contracts, unpaid internships, operational cuts, &lt;a href=&#34;http://ipswichtownfirst.wordpress.com/2014/04/03/supporters-trust-statement-on-inclusion-of-academy-contribution-in-season-ticket-renewal/&#34;&gt;dodgy renewal policies&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;#8217;re a million miles from the Cobbolds, or even David Sheepshanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes me sad, but I&amp;#8217;m not sure many of my fellow fans are that bothered, which makes me even sadder. Still, we&amp;#8217;re hardly in a minority, as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/may/01/premier-league-accounts-club-by-club-david-conn?view=mobile#&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Guardian&amp;#8217;s&lt;/cite&gt; report on the state of 2012–2013 Premier League finances and ownership&lt;/a&gt; shows. It&amp;#8217;s a tale of tax evasion, foreign ownership, hairily leveraged finance and payday loan and casino sponsorship (even ownership in one case).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few good guys in there. Best of all Swansea – run and owned by local people and the Supporters Trust (and let&amp;#8217;s remember our own excellent &lt;a href=&#34;http://ipswichtownfirst.wordpress.com/&#34;&gt;independent Supporters Trust&lt;/a&gt;). Honourable mentions to Everton, Norwich (ahem), Wigan and West Bromwich Albion. But that&amp;#8217;s about it. The rest is Russian oligarchs, Gulf dynasties and holding companies – lots of holding companies – based in Jersey, the Bahamas, Nevada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may well ask &lt;em&gt;so what?&lt;/em&gt; You don&amp;#8217;t hear many Manchester City or Liverpool fans moaning about their owners while they get to watch exciting, winning football. Indeed, City fans are very thankful to their royal benefactors:&lt;figure class=&#34;figure alignnone&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://leonpaternoster.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/sheikh.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Man City banner thanking Sheikh Mansoor&#34; width=&#34;699&#34; height=&#34;296&#34; /&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&#34;secondary&#34;&gt;City fans thank their billionaire benefactors&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
Perhaps place, history and experience are simply commodities to be traded as part of a club&amp;#8217;s global brand, however much &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mcfc.com/News/Club-news/2014/February/Barclays-You-Are-Football-story&#34;&gt;we and advertisers protest how essential they are&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps all that matters to fans is a bit of excitement and success, and maybe some sort of relationship with the team – it was very sweet seeing Luke Chambers&amp;#8217; son in front of the North Stand after the last game of this season. But to me football means a bit more. After all, teams are named after places, not businesses or families.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>5 ways to use in site search data to improve your website</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2014/05/5-ways-to-use-in-site-search-data-to-improve-your-website/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 04 May 2014 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/2014/05/5-ways-to-use-in-site-search-data-to-improve-your-website/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Keep your users&amp;#8217; website search queries within easy reach to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See what’s important to them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn their language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And know how your search engine works to make improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are 5 ways I use in site search data:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_0&#34;&gt;1. Add search data to your CMS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s pretty easy to set up Google Analytics (GA) to track what your customers search for on your website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s better when you have search data to hand. If you’re managing a website you’ll be spending most your day–to–day time in your Content Management System (CMS), so that’s where you should be able to find search data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the &lt;a href=&#34;http://suffolklibraries.co.uk&#34;&gt;Suffolk Libraries&lt;/a&gt; website I use &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.relevanssi.com/&#34;&gt;Relevanssi&lt;/a&gt;, which displays user queries in the WordPress dashboard.&lt;figure class=&#34;figure alignnone&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://leonpaternoster.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/search-screenshot.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Relevanssi search queries&#34; width=&#34;760&#34; height=&#34;599&#34; /&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&#34;secondary&#34;&gt;The Relevanssi user searches page&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
I look at search queries whenever I have a couple of minutes spare, so I can make and test little copy and structural changes all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_1&#34;&gt;2. Use search terms to write pages and structure your site&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If users are searching for the same thing over and over again it could indicate:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’re missing some important content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customers can’t find important content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Or, more simply, what users come to your website to look for (remember: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nngroup.com/articles/search-navigation/&#34;&gt;many visitors head straight for your search box&lt;/a&gt; and don’t bother too much with navigation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever it indicates you might need to take action. Think about:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;writing new content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rewriting existing content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;making important content easier to find (perhaps by providing a shortcut on your home page, or by restructuring/streamlining your existing navigation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_2&#34;&gt;3. Learn your users’ language&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organisations use different words from users to describe the service they offer. Whether the organisational lingo is ‘better ’ than the user’s doesn’t matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may refer to &lt;em&gt;titles&lt;/em&gt; because the library offers books, films, epubs, CDs, DVDs, streaming and MP3s and it’s a convenient umbrella term. However, when users come to your website they often (but not always) have a particular format in mind. They want to borrow a book, so they search for something like &lt;em&gt;how do I borrow a book online&lt;/em&gt;. So your pages have to contain the terms &lt;em&gt;borrow&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;book&lt;/em&gt; (or you need to work on synonyms).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll see this analysis doesn’t just apply to how you label services. It can get quite complex when users think about processes, such as borrowing and renewing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_3&#34;&gt;4. Know how your search engine works&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve identified a problem and written some content you’re nearly there. The final piece of the jigsaw is understanding how your search engine will find that content and display it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to think about:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What types of content the engine searches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How the engine does relevancy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can it handle synonyms?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_4&#34;&gt;Content types&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relevanssi allows you to omit or weight certain post types and comments from search results. So you can stop comments appearing in results, or make sure the engine favours pages over comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At any one time we have several thousand events published on the website (which is probably a problem in and of itself). We’ve therefore taken the decision to exclude events from search results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_5&#34;&gt;Relevancy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A decent search engine attempts to sort search results by how relevant they are to the searcher. The simplest mechanism to control relevancy is through field (title, content, excerpt etc.) weighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, you can assign each WordPress post field a score which Relevanssi uses to calculate how relevant the post is. You can use this to make the title field a lot more important than, say, the excerpt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you’ve weighted fields you can make sure titles contain common user search words and terms so they appear among the first results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_6&#34;&gt;Synonyms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We often label &lt;em&gt;things&lt;/em&gt; with different words, which may have slightly different meanings. Words drop out of popular usage over time, so what’s now a &lt;em&gt;bucket&lt;/em&gt; was once, more or less, a &lt;em&gt;pail&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Search engines let you group several words under one meaning. So I could make &lt;em&gt;book&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;title&lt;/em&gt; mean the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I say &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt;. I haven’t really used this Relevanssi feature as language usage is so unpredictable. What if someone really wanted to search for something to do with the titles of books rather than books? What if you use &lt;em&gt;title&lt;/em&gt; to mean title rather than &lt;em&gt;book&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_7&#34;&gt;5. Test your search set up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Search can be a complex beast, especially if you&amp;#8217;ve got lots of options to tweak (which is why using &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/cse/&#34;&gt;Google Custom Search Engine&lt;/a&gt; often appeals).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re making extensive or complex changes, test them out on your staging site first, and keep an eye on your search logs and analytics once you&amp;#8217;ve made them live.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>3 things to do with a website content audit</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2014/04/3-things-to-do-with-a-website-content-audit/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 22 Apr 2014 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/2014/04/3-things-to-do-with-a-website-content-audit/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;A year or so ago I posted &lt;a href=&#34;http://leonpaternoster.com/2013/04/carrying-out-a-web-content-audit/&#34; title=&#34;Carrying out a web content audit&#34;&gt;a guide to carrying out a content audit&lt;/a&gt;. At the time I was getting to grips with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://suffolklibraries.co.uk&#34;&gt;Suffolk Libraries&lt;/a&gt; website, and the audit was a really useful way to understand the library service and what we were trying to do online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we have a (hopefully) sane IA and most of the redundant content has been stripped away, the audit has a different purpose. I use it to prune pages and make sure everything&amp;#8217;s up to date. The original audit took days, now it takes on hour or two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here are 3 things you can do with a content audit once you&amp;#8217;re happy with your website&amp;#8217;s structure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_0&#34;&gt;1. Make sure content is assigned to the right owner&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Staff move on, go on paternity leave or get promoted. Your organisation structure changes too. Update your content owners accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_1&#34;&gt;2. Delete pages and files&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Suffolk Libraries website consists of 144 static pages, including redirects. This is manageable for one person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fewer pages and files make it easier to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;structure your website&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;return relevant results from searches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;navigate pages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the first question you need to ask of any page or file is &lt;em&gt;do we need this?* If you think the answer&amp;#8217;s *no&lt;/em&gt;, check your analytics and search logs and ask the content owner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_2&#34;&gt;3. Update content&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;ll probably have an idea of what content needs updating, but the audit will &lt;em&gt;force&lt;/em&gt; you to review everything. It&amp;#8217;ll throw light on those obscure corners of the website you&amp;#8217;d forgotten about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information ages quite naturally, but sometimes something unpredictable happens. For example, a new government might make changes to the National Curriculum, so your children&amp;#8217;s reading advice pages might need updating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often content owners will come to you with changes, but it&amp;#8217;s ultimately your responsibility to make sure everything&amp;#8217;s up to date. And it&amp;#8217;s a good thing when you show enough interest in other people&amp;#8217;s content to ask questions about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first content audit I did for Suffolk Libraries was a major piece of work, but it was really important to get a handle on the website. Now it&amp;#8217;s a relatively painless way to keep the site lean and healthy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The problem with cookie banners</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2014/03/the-problem-with-cookie-banners/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 30 Mar 2014 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/2014/03/the-problem-with-cookie-banners/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Following &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/bensmithuk/status/450025400799076353&#34;&gt;Ben’s tweet about CNET’s less than unobtrusive cookie opt–in popup&lt;/a&gt;, I got thinking about these messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re now so common you probably don’t even notice them, even when they take up 112px of your laptop screen:&lt;figure class=&#34;figure alignnone&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Screenshot of the BBC football website with a cookie banner at the top&#34; src=&#34;http://leonpaternoster.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/cookie-message.jpg&#34; width=&#34;800&#34; height=&#34;403&#34; /&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&#34;secondary&#34;&gt;The BBC Football website&amp;#8217;s big cookie banner. How many people ignore it and just carry on browsing?&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_0&#34;&gt;4 reasons cookie banners are useless&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unless you’re putting 3rd party ads on your site, you don’t need them
:   In June 2012 the EU data protection authorities adopted an “opinion” that:
:   &amp;gt; First party analytics cookies are not likely to create a privacy risk if websites provide clear information about the cookies to users and privacy safeguards, eg a user friendly mechanism to opt out from any data collection and where they ensure that identifiable information is anonymised. &lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://ico.org.uk/for_organisations/privacy_and_electronic_communications/the_guide/cookies&#34;&gt;ICO Cookie Guidance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
:   In other words, if you’re using Google Analytics to collect data about your own website, you’re fine. You can’t tell &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt; is using your website through analytics, and “clear” doesn’t mean “big banner on every page”. We interpreted it as an entry in the help menu and &lt;a href=&#34;http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/help/privacy-and-cookies/&#34;&gt;a plainly written explanation of what information we collect and what we use it for&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’re a pain
:   They get in the way. They make your visitors read something, interpret it and then make a decision, when all they wanted to do was read the news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;So you just ignore them
:   We associate banners with advertising, and over the years we’ve learned to filter them out. If a cookie banner does catch our attention, it always says exactly the same thing – another reason not to bother reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They use marketese
:   You see, we’re not putting this cookie on your computer so we can track which pages you visit, tell what device you’re using and figure out where you came to our website from. Oh no, it’s to &lt;em&gt;improve your experience&lt;/em&gt;.
:   Of course, we may well use all this information to improve your experience of our website. But that’s not what the cookies themselves do. And we could use all that information for a host of other purposes.
:   If there’s one area where we need to write plainly it’s privacy. &lt;a href=&#34;http://leonpaternoster.com/2014/02/mozilla-is-selling-ads-although-its-coy-about-telling-us/&#34; title=&#34;Mozilla is selling ads, although it’s coy about telling us&#34;&gt;Talk of user experience is often a smokescreen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_1&#34;&gt;A bodged law&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is wrong for us to put files on our website visitors’ computers without their explicit permission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The law should have made it illegal to set cookies without visitors opting in. Instead, we’re allowed to assume they’re OK with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, if we had a proper law no–one would bother opting in, and a big bit of the internet would break.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ditching gmail is easy and good for you</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2014/03/ditching-gmail-is-easy-and-good-for-you/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2014 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been uhmming and ahhing over moving to a different email provider for a few years now. I&amp;#8217;ve finally started the process and can report it&amp;#8217;s relatively painless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key is to do things gradually, rather than move everything over lock, stock and barrel and switch gmail off straight away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_0&#34;&gt;Why leave gmail?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like most people, I signed up for gmail when it offered huge amounts of storage compared to other providers. Also, and this is hard to believe, we all thought Google was a nice, trendy kind of company. That was around 2004.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then we&amp;#8217;ve had NSA, austerity and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2197482/google-won-t-be-paying-much-uk-tax&#34;&gt;tax avoidance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://arstechnica.com/business/2013/05/larry-page-wants-you-to-stop-worrying-and-let-him-fix-the-world/&#34;&gt;lunatic Ayn Rand philosophy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://leonpaternoster.com/2013/11/google-plus-autogenerated-pages-for-businesses-a-pain/&#34; title=&#34;Google plus generated pages cause problems&#34;&gt;Google Plus&lt;/a&gt;. Less and less &lt;em&gt;do no evil&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#8217;t have to be a conspiracy theorist to worry at Google&amp;#8217;s attempts to control your whole online life (or Apple&amp;#8217;s, or Facebook&amp;#8217;s, for that matter).&lt;figure class=&#34;figure alignnone&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;The Google founders in a car&#34; src=&#34;http://leonpaternoster.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/google-owners.jpg&#34; width=&#34;800&#34; height=&#34;345&#34; /&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&#34;secondary&#34;&gt;Larry Page in the driving seat of a Google car&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
Over the years I&amp;#8217;ve accumulated around 3GB of email, so moving to another provider *seemed* daunting. It&amp;#8217;s actually really simple, but it will take some time (and just a small bit of effort) and does assume you&amp;#8217;ve prioritised your gmail (by starring important emails, for example).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best thing is you&amp;#8217;ll be in control of your email again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_1&#34;&gt;Never delete an email is a rubbish approach&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google says there&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://gmailblog.blogspot.co.uk/2008/04/9-reasons-to-archive.html&#34;&gt;no need to delete your email&lt;/a&gt;. That sounds great, not least because it saves you making a decision when you read an email. Just archive it instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, your email is gold to Google: that&amp;#8217;s where all that juicy online behaviour data sits. The more data Google can mine, the more value it extracts from you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But never deleting email makes finding stuff difficult. True, Google has a stellar search engine, but the more email you accumulate the less meaningful search queries become. And the more work you have to do to find important messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fewer emails you have the easier it is to find, prioritise and act on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why keep &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; those messages? Google will try and scare you into thinking the email you&amp;#8217;ve just deleted &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; be vital after all. But I can count the times I&amp;#8217;ve *needed* to find an email I didn&amp;#8217;t immediately star on the fingers of one hand. Important stuff should be obvious by definition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;#8217;ve rid yourself of the &lt;em&gt;never delete anything ever&lt;/em&gt; philosophy, you can take the plunge as you won&amp;#8217;t need to import thousands of emails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_2&#34;&gt;Moving from gmail&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing to realise is you&amp;#8217;re not going to close your Google account straight away. The migration is a gradual process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Follow these steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose an alternative email provider&lt;/strong&gt;. I looked through this excellent &lt;a href=&#34;http://thesimplecomputer.info/free-webmail-for-better-privacy/&#34;&gt;list of secure, privacy aware providers&lt;/a&gt; and plumped for a &lt;a href=&#34;http://unseen.is&#34;&gt;free, 500MB Unseen email account&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go through your starred email&lt;/strong&gt; and evaluate whether each item really is important. If it is, forward it to your new email address.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create an &lt;em&gt;Important&lt;/em&gt; folder&lt;/strong&gt; in your new email account. Move all the gmail starred emails to this folder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Autoforward all your new gmail emails to your new account&lt;/strong&gt; (look for &lt;em&gt;Settings &lt;/em&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;POP and forwarding&lt;/em&gt;. Google doesn&amp;#8217;t care if you forward email, as long as it sees it.)*&lt;br /&gt;
*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Import your gmail contacts&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;http://support.unseen.is/031257-How-to-enter-contacts-in-your-address-book&#34;&gt;Unseen can import gmail contacts automatically&lt;/a&gt;, although gmail will block the process until you OK it. Try it once then login to your gmail account to tell Google Unseen is legitimate, then try again.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set your autoresponder&lt;/strong&gt; to tell people you&amp;#8217;ve changed email address (via &lt;em&gt;Settings &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/em&gt;*&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;General)*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#8217;s it, to start with. Once you&amp;#8217;ve got your new email address up and running, &lt;strong&gt;make a decision whenever a new email arrives in your new inbox&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you need to act on it keep it in the Inbox&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it contains important reference information (hosting account details, for example) move it to an *Important* folder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it&amp;#8217;s a subscription you don&amp;#8217;t bother reading go and click the unsubscribe link and delete the email. If you want to keep the subscription, update it with your new email address.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it&amp;#8217;s worthless delete it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re unsure move it to an *Archive* folder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, you can refer to your old gmail whenever necessary, and if you did need one of those thousands of archived emails, forward it to your new account and file it in the &lt;em&gt;Important&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Archive&lt;/em&gt; folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_3&#34;&gt;Turning gmail off&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the whole point of this is to ditch gmail. Simply forwarding email to a new service doesn&amp;#8217;t really achieve anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#8217;t made the final step yet: I want to make sure everything is OK with Unseen. If things don&amp;#8217;t go well, all your email will still be sitting on Google&amp;#8217;s servers, and you can either go back or start the process again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;#8217;re happy you can get rid of those thousands of untouched, archived emails, you&amp;#8217;ll need to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell everyone your new email address&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/how-to-close-your-google-account/2012/01/25/gIQADAxbQQ_story.html&#34;&gt;Close your gmail account&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And why not get rid of Plus while you&amp;#8217;re at it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Responsive versus works in IE6</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2014/03/responsive-versus-works-in-ie6/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 08 Mar 2014 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/2014/03/responsive-versus-works-in-ie6/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Stats from 4 days’ worth of &lt;a href=&#34;http://suffolklibraries.co.uk&#34;&gt;Suffolk Libraries&lt;/a&gt; website traffic:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proportion of visits from mobiles and tablets: 1 in 4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proportion of visits using Internet Explorer 6: 1 in 500&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Suffolk Libraries website is responsive. Cost to build: £0 – I did it, so I guess there’s my web manager salary, but I do all the other web stuff too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at another library service’s website (or, more specifically, another library’s website): &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.libraryofbirmingham.com/&#34;&gt;The Library of Birmingham&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-25033651&#34;&gt;Cost to build £1.2m&lt;/a&gt;. Annual running costs £190,000. I don’t earn £190,000 a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outsourcing isn’t always cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Library of Birmingham’s website isn’t responsive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does, however, work in Internet Explorer 6. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/179465/response/452527/attach/html/3/FOI%209309%20Parry%20Final%20response%20Attach%201.doc.html&#34;&gt;They did ask for it to work in IE6&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is the most accessible?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mozilla, money, adverts and corporate speak</title>

&lt;p&gt;What to make of Mozilla.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? Well, Mozilla gave us Firefox – my browser of choice on Windows, Debian and Android – which slayed Internet Explorer. The online lives of millions have been improved immeasurably by IE&amp;#8217;s demise. Too bad for Firefox Chrome mopped up to become the planet&amp;#8217;s most popular browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mozilla, unlike Google, is a not-for-profit organisation, which means it builds Firefox so you can browse the internet and &lt;em&gt;control&lt;/em&gt; how you browse. Mozilla&amp;#8217;s only motive is to build an excellent browser for its users. That&amp;#8217;s a simple, useful and transparent relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your relationship with Chrome and Google is murkier. While Chrome is free (and a better browser than Firefox), Google&amp;#8217;s ultimate motive is to direct you to its advertisers&amp;#8217; products and/or sell information about you and your browsing habits to advertisers. That&amp;#8217;s why Chrome made the address bar a search box as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making Chrome a shithot browser &lt;em&gt;helps&lt;/em&gt; Google make money, but that&amp;#8217;s not its &lt;em&gt;raison d&amp;#8217;etre&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_0&#34;&gt;Adverts and corporate speak at Mozilla&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So until recently I had a romantic view of Mozilla. I assumed it was a smallish operation, staffed by talented designers and engineers and a few business types keeping everything running smoothly. I didn&amp;#8217;t even think about stuff like income until I read this post on &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.mozilla.org/advancingcontent/2014/02/11/publisher-transformation-with-users-at-the-center/&#34;&gt;plans to put ads on the Firefox start screen&lt;/a&gt;. (Note: Mozilla pulled the post, but you can &lt;a href=&#34;https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:https%3A%2F%2Fblog.mozilla.org%2Fadvancingcontent%2F2014%2F02%2F11%2Fpublisher-transformation-with-users-at-the-center%2F&#34;&gt;grab an archived Google copy&lt;/a&gt;. So it goes.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t think ads sit well with a not for profit, but &lt;a href=&#34;http://leonpaternoster.com/2014/02/mozilla-is-selling-ads-although-its-coy-about-telling-us/&#34; title=&#34;Mozilla is selling ads, although it’s coy about telling us&#34;&gt;the article&amp;#8217;s language concerns me even more&lt;/a&gt;. Corporate and obfuscatory. A tech insider armed with some slick phrases and bad news. I sniffed money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_1&#34;&gt;Mozilla, selling search to Google and (lots of) money&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason you put ads in something is to generate income. Whatever Mozilla claim, it&amp;#8217;s not to make your product better for users. So let&amp;#8217;s take a look at Mozilla&amp;#8217;s money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://thenextweb.com/insider/2013/11/21/mozillas-reliance-google-increasing-90-2012-revenue-came-one-source/&#34;&gt;The majority of Mozilla&amp;#8217;s income comes from a deal it&amp;#8217;s struck with Google&lt;/a&gt;. When you tap a search into Firefox it sends it to Google. In turn, Google makes money whenever anyone clicks on an ad in its search results. As &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.w3counter.com/globalstats.php?year=2014&amp;amp;month=1&#34;&gt;Firefox still accounts for just over 18% of the world&amp;#8217;s internet traffic&lt;/a&gt;, that&amp;#8217;s presumably a lot of money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has been the case for several years, but you might ask whether it&amp;#8217;s in the user&amp;#8217;s best interests. I&amp;#8217;m not sure. &lt;a href=&#34;http://inlibrary.suffolklibraries.co.uk&#34;&gt;Our library PC home page&lt;/a&gt; features a big Google search box because our PC users more often than not equate &lt;em&gt;search the internet&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;em&gt;search Google&lt;/em&gt;, and the first thing they do when they login to a PC is perform a search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#8217;t make money from search (perhaps we should) – we&amp;#8217;re doing what we think library users want us to do. If they wanted something different, we could change search engine easily, perhaps to &lt;a href=&#34;https://duckduckgo.com/&#34;&gt;Duck Duck Go&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mozilla can&amp;#8217;t change, so whether Google would be most people&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;choice&lt;/em&gt; of search engine anyway is a moot point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, Google provides the best product, but being the best search engine is not an end in itself. The ultimate aim is to get people to click on adverts, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://leonpaternoster.com/2013/11/google-plus-autogenerated-pages-for-businesses-a-pain/&#34; title=&#34;Google plus generated pages cause problems&#34;&gt;businesses on Google Plus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not sure this sits well with a not for profit, and I&amp;#8217;d argue it stretches points 2, 4, 5 and 8 of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/&#34;&gt;Mozilla Manifesto&lt;/a&gt; (but hey, point 9 makes everything OK, and the whole thing&amp;#8217;s too fluffy anyway).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, Google accounts for over 90% of Mozilla&amp;#8217;s income, which means it&amp;#8217;s in the odd situation of being funded by its biggest competitor. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.w3counter.com/trends&#34;&gt;Chrome&amp;#8217;s browser share has increased at Firefox&amp;#8217;s expense&lt;/a&gt;. And the actual amount? Well, that&amp;#8217;s subject to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/foundation/annualreport/2012/faq/&#34;&gt;&lt;q&gt;traditional confidentiality requirements, and we’re [Mozilla] not at liberty to disclose them&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but it&amp;#8217;s quite easy to work out. It&amp;#8217;s &lt;strong&gt;just under $300m a year&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which raises more questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_2&#34;&gt;What is Mozilla for?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not for profits have a contradictory relationship with money. On the one hand they exist for an explicitly noncommercial purpose, while on the other they&amp;#8217;re often under pressure to increase income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How they negotiate this paradox is fundamental. If a not for profit makes lots of money but loses sight of its original purpose it becomes a bog standard business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the moment, Mozilla &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; too much like a commercial organisation. It raises lots of income, but sells one of its fundamental features in the process. It&amp;#8217;s making noises about selling ads on its start page. It signs nondisclosure agreements with its partners. It speaks in pettifogging, corporate lingo. All while asking for donations (and getting $800,000 a year).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;300 million. I guess developing Firefox, Thunderbird and Firefox OS doesn&amp;#8217;t come cheap, and nor do &lt;a href=&#34;http://spiekermann.com/en/&#34;&gt;Erik Spiekermann&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://clearleft.com/made/mozilla-add-ons&#34;&gt;Clear Left&lt;/a&gt;. Just because you&amp;#8217;re a not for profit doesn&amp;#8217;t mean you shouldn&amp;#8217;t get the best in design. But that still seems an awful lot, and I bet a fair old wodge goes on employing some &lt;a href=&#34;http://about.me/darrenjayherman&#34;&gt;expensive marketing and advertising staff&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, no reason why Mozilla shouldn&amp;#8217;t hire the best, but it&amp;#8217;d be a tragedy if it lost sight of what it&amp;#8217;s for in the process. Let&amp;#8217;s hope the corporate bods will learn as they go along, but &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2014/02/13/revenue-diversification-the-mozilla-way/&#34;&gt;don&amp;#8217;t hold your breath&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/2014/02/mozilla-is-selling-ads-although-its-coy-about-telling-us/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tell me — when you &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.mozilla.org/advancingcontent/2014/02/11/publisher-transformation-with-users-at-the-center/&#34;&gt;read this blog post&lt;/a&gt; (note: it was pulled by Mozilla, but you can &lt;a href=&#34;https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:https%3A%2F%2Fblog.mozilla.org%2Fadvancingcontent%2F2014%2F02%2F11%2Fpublisher-transformation-with-users-at-the-center%2F&#34;&gt;grab an archived page&lt;/a&gt;), what&amp;#8217;s the most important thing it conveys?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finished it? Good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, was it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mozilla designs things for its users?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mozilla is improving its start page?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mozilla is selling ads on its start page?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which of those statements do you think Mozilla wants you to remember?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And which is the biggest news to Mozilla blog readers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s that article in numbers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Number of paragraphs before adverts are mentioned: 7&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Number of words in sentence announcing adverts: 39&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Number of words in said sentence before adverts are mentioned: 26&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Number of features mentioned before adverts in said sentence: 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Number of times the word “advert” is used: 0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Number of times the word “user” or “users” is used: 12&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Number of buzzword verbs: 9 (“align”, “deliver” etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Number of references to irrelevant business meetings: 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You get the picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not sure what I think about Mozilla selling ads. It &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; wrong, but perhaps it wouldn&amp;#8217;t bother me – I&amp;#8217;d just ignore start page ads just as I ignore every other ad I see on the internet. I would miss history tiles, especially on Firefox mobile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does bother me is the confusing, buzzword ridden language they use to tell us something relatively important. Has it always been this way? Or is it something new? Whatever the answer, it makes me suspicious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Yes, I do like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/styleguide/products/firefox-os/typeface/&#34;&gt;Fira Sans&lt;/a&gt;, though.)&lt;/p&gt;
