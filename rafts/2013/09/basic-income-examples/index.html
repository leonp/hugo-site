<p>Now, we all know a basic citizen income will never happen in the UK, because of <a href="/2013/09/basic-income/">our punitive attitude to benefits</a>. However, it&#8217;s interesting to look at how it would affect us <em>if</em> we actually created a system that supported people regardless of their circumstances. We can but dream.</p>

<p>The following scenarios and figures are based on <a href="http://www.citizensincome.org/MoneyforEveryone.htm">Dr Malcolm Torry&#8217;s work for the Citizen&#8217;s Income Trust</a> (see Appendix 16). He claims the proposals are revenue neutral.</p>

<p>The state would give every citizen a fixed income regardless of their salary, pension, investment income, age and marital status. Dr Torry proposes income levels based on current income support and pension credit rates:</p>

  Weekly basic citizen income amounts
</p>

<h2 id="toc_0">Example 1</h2>

<p>A and B are married and have two school aged children. A earns the national average wage of £26,500 a year. B hasn&#8217;t worked for four years in order to bring up the children. B would like to find a part–time job or course in order to begin a return to work.</p>

<p>The family collects £160 a month in child tax credits and £134 child benefit.</p>

<p>After tax and national insurance (NI) A takes home £1700 a month. This results in a total income of £1994 a month.</p>

<p>At the moment it&#8217;s next to impossible for B to find work or study, because they&#8217;ll lose their tax credits and have to start paying for pre and after school childcare, and any course costs.</p>

<p>Under a basic citizen income scheme A would pay more income tax because there&#8217;d be no tax allowance. Using the current tax rates, tax and NI add up to 32%, so A would take home £1502 a month.</p>

<p>Basic income is paid to all citizens regardless of age. Using Torry&#8217;s suggested rates, the family would receive £1103 citizen income a month. This results in a total income of £2605 a month, £611 more than the current amount.</p>

<h3 id="toc_1">How things would change</h3>

<p>B could look for work without worrying about losing child tax credits. If the government also subsidised free childcare, it would be even more attractive. Study would be a realistic option.</p>

<p>There are also several indirect benefits. A currently pays £60 accident, sickness and unemployment insurance. They wouldn&#8217;t need to pay as much because redundancy wouldn&#8217;t be as ruinous as before (moving to part–time work would be a realistic option, for example).</p>

<p>A could change their work hours to share childcare duties. It might be possible to go part–time in order to improve B&#8217;s job and study prospects.</p>

<p>A citizen income would drastically improve financial security, work and study flexibility and the quality of A and B&#8217;s life (and their children&#8217;s).</p>

<h2 id="toc_2">Example 2</h2>

<p>C brings up three children on their own. Their youngest child has turned 5, which means they have to move to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/employment-support-allowance/what-youll-get">Employment and Support Allowance (ESA)</a> benefit of £71.70 a week.</p>

<p>After 13 weeks they&#8217;ll be put into a sinisterly named “work related activity group” and face sanctions if they don&#8217;t attend job interviews or do “work–related activity”. <a href="http://www.adviceguide.org.uk/wales/benefits_w/benefits_sick_or_disabled_people_and_carers_ew/employment_and_support_allowance.htm#work-related_activity">Work related activity</a> is work for free (also known as <a href="http://www.boycottworkfare.org/">workfare</a>).</p>

<p>They currently claim £376.11 a month child tax credits and £204.10 child benefit. Total income is £890.91 a month.</p>

<p>C would like to either work part–time or, because they have no formal qualifications, begin an access course so they can train for a job.</p>

<p>C would lose their ESA under the current rules if they started a course.</p>

<p>Under the basic citizen income scheme, the family&#8217;s income would increase by a modest £148 a month to £1038.91. C wouldn&#8217;t have to start unpaid “work–related activity”, and they&#8217;d be free to either study or work part–time without losing any money.</p>

<h3 id="toc_3">How things would change</h3>

<p>C wouldn&#8217;t have to worry about a change in circumstances affecting their children&#8217;s well–being. They could also concentrate on planning some sort of career, rather than how their income changes on a week to week basis, or working for free.</p>

<p>A common theme to these examples is education. Another indirect consequence of a basic income would be a better trained workforce.</p>

<h2 id="toc_4">Why it won&#8217;t happen</h2>

<p>If Torry&#8217;s cost neutral claims are true, then it&#8217;s hard to argue against a basic citizen income. They serve the government&#8217;s aim of <em>getting people back to work</em> far better than the current means tested system.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re of a neoliberal bent they also open up several interesting possibilities around ‘flexible’ labour laws. If unemployment isn&#8217;t entirely financially ruinous, then zero hour contracts and no quibble hiring and firing may seem a little fairer than they do at the moment. (<em>Note – this isn&#8217;t my view!</em>)</p>

<p>However, the main drawback is that an untested citizen income isn&#8217;t punitive. In real life, A is encouraged to feel that they&#8217;re paying for C to ‘do nothing’ while they struggle on a low income, instead of questioning why their salary is so inadequate. Benefits and work are an exercise in division and revenge.</p>
