			<p>I started working for <a href="http://suffolklibraries.co.uk">Suffolk Libraries</a> last week. Over the next few months I&#8217;ll be rebuilding our website. If you take a look now, you&#8217;ll see why.</p>

<p>Libraries and the internet seem to share an uncomfortable relationship. I can see a few reasons for this. The main one is that Online Public Access Catalogues (OPACs) are not designed to slot into existing websites. They live as separate entities.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s why you&#8217;re shunted off to a subdomain or even a different website whenever you search for a title, whichever library website you try:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://librarycatalogue.manchester.gov.uk">Manchester Central Library</a></li>
<li><a href="https://library-opac.birmingham.gov.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/MSGTRN/OPAC/HOME">Birmingham Libraries</a></li>
<li><a href="http://nypl.bibliocommons.com/">New York Public Library</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This strikes me as exceptionally poor UX. If I go to find a book on a library website I expect to be able to find it on that site. <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/top-10-ia-mistakes/">Navigating across websites is confusing</a>. And isn&#8217;t a library essentially a collection of texts? Why aren&#8217;t they actually housed in the library?</p>

<p>Libraries have tackled this problem in two ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>Some attempt to make the OPAC seem a part of the main site. This is what we&#8217;ve done in the past, and it&#8217;s my least favourite option. The pages are styled in the same way as the rest of the website, and the navigation is replicated. This strikes me as fundamentally <em>dishonest</em>. It also makes it a PITA to make simple changes to the website IA, especially when your OPAC isn&#8217;t a CMS.</li>
<li>Others apply some light branding to the subdomain, perhaps through adding a logo. I prefer this approach as it doesn&#8217;t try and hide what&#8217;s happening to the user. But hopping between websites is a confusing experience.</li>
</ul>

<p>In an ideal world users would tap in their query and the website would display a list of search results. You&#8217;d expect this to be easy enough to implement even if the website itself didn&#8217;t store the database records. That&#8217;s what APIs are for.</p>

<p>But here we run into a second problem. Suffolk Libraries is unique in that it is a completely separate entity from its council. But its OPAC still feels like something from the world of local government â€“ it looks dated and is difficult to talk to. If you were able to come up with a library management system with an easy, open API you&#8217;d make a killing (there&#8217;s a business idea for you.)</p>

<p>It seems that providing services across disparate domains and services has become a habit. That&#8217;s why you&#8217;ll see yet more subsites popping up, such as <a href="http://manchesterdownload.lib.overdrive.com/">ebook provider Overdrive</a>.</p>

<p>I suspect this will pose the main challenge in my website redesign. Is there anyone out there with experience of dealing with OPACs? I guess screen scraping is an option. Or is there actually a way to do subdomains and separate websites well?</p>
