<p>I&#8217;ve been uhmming and ahhing over moving to a different email provider for a few years now. I&#8217;ve finally started the process and can report it&#8217;s relatively painless.</p>

<p>The key is to do things gradually, rather than move everything over lock, stock and barrel and switch gmail off straight away.</p>

<h2 id="toc_0">Why leave gmail?</h2>

<p>Like most people, I signed up for gmail when it offered huge amounts of storage compared to other providers. Also, and this is hard to believe, we all thought Google was a nice, trendy kind of company. That was around 2004.</p>

<p>Since then we&#8217;ve had NSA, austerity and <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2197482/google-won-t-be-paying-much-uk-tax">tax avoidance</a>, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2013/05/larry-page-wants-you-to-stop-worrying-and-let-him-fix-the-world/">lunatic Ayn Rand philosophy</a> and <a href="http://leonpaternoster.com/2013/11/google-plus-autogenerated-pages-for-businesses-a-pain/" title="Google plus generated pages cause problems">Google Plus</a>. Less and less <em>do no evil</em>.</p>

<p>You don&#8217;t have to be a conspiracy theorist to worry at Google&#8217;s attempts to control your whole online life (or Apple&#8217;s, or Facebook&#8217;s, for that matter).<figure class="figure alignnone"></p>

<p><img alt="The Google founders in a car" src="http://leonpaternoster.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/google-owners.jpg" width="800" height="345" /><figcaption class="secondary">Larry Page in the driving seat of a Google car</figcaption></figure>
Over the years I&#8217;ve accumulated around 3GB of email, so moving to another provider *seemed* daunting. It&#8217;s actually really simple, but it will take some time (and just a small bit of effort) and does assume you&#8217;ve prioritised your gmail (by starring important emails, for example).</p>

<p>The best thing is you&#8217;ll be in control of your email again.</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">Never delete an email is a rubbish approach</h2>

<p>Google says there&#8217;s <a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.co.uk/2008/04/9-reasons-to-archive.html">no need to delete your email</a>. That sounds great, not least because it saves you making a decision when you read an email. Just archive it instead.</p>

<p>Of course, your email is gold to Google: that&#8217;s where all that juicy online behaviour data sits. The more data Google can mine, the more value it extracts from you.</p>

<p>But never deleting email makes finding stuff difficult. True, Google has a stellar search engine, but the more email you accumulate the less meaningful search queries become. And the more work you have to do to find important messages.</p>

<p>The fewer emails you have the easier it is to find, prioritise and act on them.</p>

<p>Why keep <em>all</em> those messages? Google will try and scare you into thinking the email you&#8217;ve just deleted <em>may</em> be vital after all. But I can count the times I&#8217;ve *needed* to find an email I didn&#8217;t immediately star on the fingers of one hand. Important stuff should be obvious by definition.</p>

<p>Once you&#8217;ve rid yourself of the <em>never delete anything ever</em> philosophy, you can take the plunge as you won&#8217;t need to import thousands of emails.</p>

<h2 id="toc_2">Moving from gmail</h2>

<p>The first thing to realise is you&#8217;re not going to close your Google account straight away. The migration is a gradual process.</p>

<p>Follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Choose an alternative email provider</strong>. I looked through this excellent <a href="http://thesimplecomputer.info/free-webmail-for-better-privacy/">list of secure, privacy aware providers</a> and plumped for a <a href="http://unseen.is">free, 500MB Unseen email account</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Go through your starred email</strong> and evaluate whether each item really is important. If it is, forward it to your new email address.</li>
<li><strong>Create an <em>Important</em> folder</strong> in your new email account. Move all the gmail starred emails to this folder.</li>
<li><strong>Autoforward all your new gmail emails to your new account</strong> (look for <em>Settings </em>&gt; <em>POP and forwarding</em>. Google doesn&#8217;t care if you forward email, as long as it sees it.)*<br />
*</li>
<li><strong>Import your gmail contacts</strong> (<a href="http://support.unseen.is/031257-How-to-enter-contacts-in-your-address-book">Unseen can import gmail contacts automatically</a>, although gmail will block the process until you OK it. Try it once then login to your gmail account to tell Google Unseen is legitimate, then try again.)</li>
<li><strong>Set your autoresponder</strong> to tell people you&#8217;ve changed email address (via <em>Settings </em><em>&gt;</em>*<strong><em> </em></strong>General)*</li>
</ol>

<p>And that&#8217;s it, to start with. Once you&#8217;ve got your new email address up and running, <strong>make a decision whenever a new email arrives in your new inbox</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you need to act on it keep it in the Inbox</li>
<li>If it contains important reference information (hosting account details, for example) move it to an *Important* folder</li>
<li>If it&#8217;s a subscription you don&#8217;t bother reading go and click the unsubscribe link and delete the email. If you want to keep the subscription, update it with your new email address.</li>
<li>If it&#8217;s worthless delete it</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re unsure move it to an *Archive* folder</li>
</ul>

<p>In the meantime, you can refer to your old gmail whenever necessary, and if you did need one of those thousands of archived emails, forward it to your new account and file it in the <em>Important</em> or <em>Archive</em> folder.</p>

<h2 id="toc_3">Turning gmail off</h2>

<p>Of course, the whole point of this is to ditch gmail. Simply forwarding email to a new service doesn&#8217;t really achieve anything.</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t made the final step yet: I want to make sure everything is OK with Unseen. If things don&#8217;t go well, all your email will still be sitting on Google&#8217;s servers, and you can either go back or start the process again.</p>

<p>Once you&#8217;re happy you can get rid of those thousands of untouched, archived emails, you&#8217;ll need to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Tell everyone your new email address</li>
<li><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/how-to-close-your-google-account/2012/01/25/gIQADAxbQQ_story.html">Close your gmail account</a></li>
</ol>

<p>And why not get rid of Plus while you&#8217;re at it.</p>
