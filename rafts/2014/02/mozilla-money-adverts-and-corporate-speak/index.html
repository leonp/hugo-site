<p>What to make of Mozilla.</p>

<p>Why? Well, Mozilla gave us Firefox – my browser of choice on Windows, Debian and Android – which slayed Internet Explorer. The online lives of millions have been improved immeasurably by IE&#8217;s demise. Too bad for Firefox Chrome mopped up to become the planet&#8217;s most popular browser.</p>

<p>Mozilla, unlike Google, is a not-for-profit organisation, which means it builds Firefox so you can browse the internet and <em>control</em> how you browse. Mozilla&#8217;s only motive is to build an excellent browser for its users. That&#8217;s a simple, useful and transparent relationship.</p>

<p>Your relationship with Chrome and Google is murkier. While Chrome is free (and a better browser than Firefox), Google&#8217;s ultimate motive is to direct you to its advertisers&#8217; products and/or sell information about you and your browsing habits to advertisers. That&#8217;s why Chrome made the address bar a search box as well.</p>

<p>Making Chrome a shithot browser <em>helps</em> Google make money, but that&#8217;s not its <em>raison d&#8217;etre</em>.</p>

<h2 id="toc_0">Adverts and corporate speak at Mozilla</h2>

<p>So until recently I had a romantic view of Mozilla. I assumed it was a smallish operation, staffed by talented designers and engineers and a few business types keeping everything running smoothly. I didn&#8217;t even think about stuff like income until I read this post on <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/advancingcontent/2014/02/11/publisher-transformation-with-users-at-the-center/">plans to put ads on the Firefox start screen</a>. (Note: Mozilla pulled the post, but you can <a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:https%3A%2F%2Fblog.mozilla.org%2Fadvancingcontent%2F2014%2F02%2F11%2Fpublisher-transformation-with-users-at-the-center%2F">grab an archived Google copy</a>. So it goes.)</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think ads sit well with a not for profit, but <a href="http://leonpaternoster.com/2014/02/mozilla-is-selling-ads-although-its-coy-about-telling-us/" title="Mozilla is selling ads, although it’s coy about telling us">the article&#8217;s language concerns me even more</a>. Corporate and obfuscatory. A tech insider armed with some slick phrases and bad news. I sniffed money.</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">Mozilla, selling search to Google and (lots of) money</h2>

<p>The reason you put ads in something is to generate income. Whatever Mozilla claim, it&#8217;s not to make your product better for users. So let&#8217;s take a look at Mozilla&#8217;s money.</p>

<p><a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2013/11/21/mozillas-reliance-google-increasing-90-2012-revenue-came-one-source/">The majority of Mozilla&#8217;s income comes from a deal it&#8217;s struck with Google</a>. When you tap a search into Firefox it sends it to Google. In turn, Google makes money whenever anyone clicks on an ad in its search results. As <a href="http://www.w3counter.com/globalstats.php?year=2014&amp;month=1">Firefox still accounts for just over 18% of the world&#8217;s internet traffic</a>, that&#8217;s presumably a lot of money.</p>

<p>This has been the case for several years, but you might ask whether it&#8217;s in the user&#8217;s best interests. I&#8217;m not sure. <a href="http://inlibrary.suffolklibraries.co.uk">Our library PC home page</a> features a big Google search box because our PC users more often than not equate <em>search the internet</em> with <em>search Google</em>, and the first thing they do when they login to a PC is perform a search.</p>

<p>We don&#8217;t make money from search (perhaps we should) – we&#8217;re doing what we think library users want us to do. If they wanted something different, we could change search engine easily, perhaps to <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">Duck Duck Go</a>.</p>

<p>Mozilla can&#8217;t change, so whether Google would be most people&#8217;s <em>choice</em> of search engine anyway is a moot point.</p>

<p>Again, Google provides the best product, but being the best search engine is not an end in itself. The ultimate aim is to get people to click on adverts, and <a href="http://leonpaternoster.com/2013/11/google-plus-autogenerated-pages-for-businesses-a-pain/" title="Google plus generated pages cause problems">businesses on Google Plus</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure this sits well with a not for profit, and I&#8217;d argue it stretches points 2, 4, 5 and 8 of the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/">Mozilla Manifesto</a> (but hey, point 9 makes everything OK, and the whole thing&#8217;s too fluffy anyway).</p>

<p>Still, Google accounts for over 90% of Mozilla&#8217;s income, which means it&#8217;s in the odd situation of being funded by its biggest competitor. <a href="http://www.w3counter.com/trends">Chrome&#8217;s browser share has increased at Firefox&#8217;s expense</a>. And the actual amount? Well, that&#8217;s subject to <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/foundation/annualreport/2012/faq/"><q>traditional confidentiality requirements, and we’re [Mozilla] not at liberty to disclose them</q></a>, but it&#8217;s quite easy to work out. It&#8217;s <strong>just under $300m a year</strong>.</p>

<p>Which raises more questions.</p>

<h2 id="toc_2">What is Mozilla for?</h2>

<p>Not for profits have a contradictory relationship with money. On the one hand they exist for an explicitly noncommercial purpose, while on the other they&#8217;re often under pressure to increase income.</p>

<p>How they negotiate this paradox is fundamental. If a not for profit makes lots of money but loses sight of its original purpose it becomes a bog standard business.</p>

<p>At the moment, Mozilla <em>feels</em> too much like a commercial organisation. It raises lots of income, but sells one of its fundamental features in the process. It&#8217;s making noises about selling ads on its start page. It signs nondisclosure agreements with its partners. It speaks in pettifogging, corporate lingo. All while asking for donations (and getting $800,000 a year).</p>

<p>300 million. I guess developing Firefox, Thunderbird and Firefox OS doesn&#8217;t come cheap, and nor do <a href="http://spiekermann.com/en/">Erik Spiekermann</a> and <a href="http://clearleft.com/made/mozilla-add-ons">Clear Left</a>. Just because you&#8217;re a not for profit doesn&#8217;t mean you shouldn&#8217;t get the best in design. But that still seems an awful lot, and I bet a fair old wodge goes on employing some <a href="http://about.me/darrenjayherman">expensive marketing and advertising staff</a>.</p>

<p>Again, no reason why Mozilla shouldn&#8217;t hire the best, but it&#8217;d be a tragedy if it lost sight of what it&#8217;s for in the process. Let&#8217;s hope the corporate bods will learn as they go along, but <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2014/02/13/revenue-diversification-the-mozilla-way/">don&#8217;t hold your breath</a>.</p>
